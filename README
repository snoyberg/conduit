Turn WAI applications into standalone GUIs using Qt WebKit.

Linux
=====

You'll need the appropriate system libraries, on Ubuntu:

    apt-get install libqtwebkit-dev

On Lucid, this required adding a PPA:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports


Windows
=======

* Install the Qt SDK from <http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/>

* Your application's Cabal file will require certain options for
  Windows, shown below.  In particular, we need to link with `g++`, so
  make sure it's in your `PATH`.  The option `-optl-mwindows` ensures
  that the application does not open a terminal.

        if os(windows)
          ghc-options: -Wall -threaded -pgml g++ -optl-static -optl-mwindows
        else
          ghc-options: -Wall

* Run `cabal-install` with the Qt `include` and `lib` directories.

        export QT_PATH=c:/QtSDK/Desktop/Qt/4.7.3/mingw

        cabal-dev install \
          --extra-include-dirs=$QT_PATH/include \
          --extra-include-dirs=$QT_PATH/include/QtCore \
          --extra-include-dirs=$QT_PATH/include/QtNetwork \
          --extra-include-dirs=$QT_PATH/include/QtGui \
          --extra-include-dirs=$QT_PATH/include/QtWebKit \
          --extra-lib-dirs=$QT_PATH/lib

* You'll need to include these DLLs with your application:

        phonon4.dll
        libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll
        QtCore4.dll
        QtGui4.dll
        QtNetwork4.dll
        QtWebKit4.dll
