-- | A method for acquiring a scarce resource, providing the means of freeing
-- it when no longer needed. This data type provides
-- @Functor@/@Applicative@/@Monad@ instances for composing different resources
-- together. You can allocate these resources using either the @bracket@
-- pattern (via @with@) or using @ResourceT@ (via @allocateAcquire@).
--
-- This concept was originally introduced by Gabriel Gonzalez and described at:
-- <http://www.haskellforall.com/2013/06/the-resource-applicative.html>. The
-- implementation in this package is slightly different, due to taking a
-- different approach to async exception safety.
