## resourcet

Please see [the full tutorial on School of Haskell](https://www.fpcomplete.com/user/snoyberg/library-documentation/resourcet).

This package was originally included with the conduit package, but has existed as a separate package for quite a while. It is fully usable outside of conduit.
